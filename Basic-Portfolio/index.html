        <p1>My name is Daniel Jacquez. I am 28 years old. After about a decade of not being in a school environment my wife essentially made me go back to school. I have always loved technology growing up. Although coding is entirely new to me I have started to understand it a bit more. Writing a web page reminds me of when I first learned to DJ. Many DJ's these days learn to dj with a computer in front of their face and not actually being about to match the beat by ear. Once I learned to DJ without a laptop my skill level increased dramatically. I believe it is the same with coding with using plain html and css. You are able to learn the backbone and be more creative without having something essentially making your decisions follow a certain path such as with bootstrap.</p1>
